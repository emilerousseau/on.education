# on.education
An educational project of benefit to the entire Angular community.

When complete, this repository will contain a project fully illustrating what is likely _the_ most critically important concept in Angular programming, which has so far been only sporadically covered at best, and even then with gaps, errors and omissions in every iteration. So much so that it has often been necessary to synthesise numerous different sources in order to create a fully working project.

It is a sincere belief that technology should be a means to enable creativity, and to aid in the overcoming of the problems of this age via the harnessing and enabling of grass-roots level coders. As such the teaching of understanding of technology should be open, honest and as error free as possible.

"How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it." -- Adam Smith
